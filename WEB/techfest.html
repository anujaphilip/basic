<h1>About US</h1>
<p>

16 years ago, a group of student visionaries set up a humble symposium for curious minds to create, adapt and advance in the ever growing world of technology. Encompassing all the elements for the perfect techfest, today Tathva, the annual techno-management festival of NIT Calicut has grown into one of the biggest fiestas the nation has ever witnessed. Tathva is the flight of a single banner that draws countless followers each year, united in their quest for technical and artistic excellence.

Growing at an exponential rate since its genesis in 2002, Tathva aims to surpass all boundaries and set higher standards every year for colleges all over the country. Beckoning forth the masses with a plethora of events, workshops, competitions and pronites, it has become more of a celebration. With Tathva '16, we hope to harness the future tehcnocrats to bring about an evolution. So put on your party hats and strap on your thinking gear as we dive deep into a journey unlike anything you've experienced before.
