							    <p>Organ donation is the donation of biological tissue or an organ  of the human body from a living or dead person to a living recipient in need of  a transplantation. Transplantable organs and tissues are removed In a surgical  procedure following a determination, based on the donors medical and social  history, of which are suitable for transplantation. Organs you can donate  incudes:- kidney, heart ,liver ,pancreas ,intestine ,lungs ,cornea ,eye. Organ  donation can benefit the recipient largely by improving health, quality and span of his life and even save him from death  or other critical conditions .it is an ultimate humanitarian act of charity.</p>
							  </li>
								<li>
									<p>Any person above the age of 18 is eligible to  become a donor. Even younger population under 18 can donate with permission  from parent or guardian. The most surprising fact about organ donation is that  some organs can be donated even when a person is alive. Most organs are however  transplanted only after the donor is dead. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>A person is considered brain dead when there is  NO brain function whatsoever and there is no chance of recovering any brain  function.it is only after a patient is declared to be brain dead that the  organs are donated. Agreeing to donate organs does not affect the quality of  care a person receives.<br>
Organ donation is not a tragedy, but it can be a  beautiful light in the midst of one. The decision to donate organs is yours.so  Be a hero …………….Give the second chance of LIFE</p>
